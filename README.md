# NQueens
Variation of the original n queens problem where the position of the first queen is fixed and the function has to place the remaining queens such that no other queens should be in the same row, column and diagonal axes. Instead of just a standard chessboard, the board size used for this simulation can be 5x5, 6x6, ... up to 10x10.
